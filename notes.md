NodeJs 
-----

**Non blocking event driven IO**

Apache - single threaded
But you have to wait to do other orders
**blocking**

NodeJs

- Single threaded but thread serves all functions
- **Asynchronously**
- Tasks are just new events
- Events are carried out in order they were raised  

` THIS MEANS NODE APPS CAN BE REPLICATED EASILY `



# Asycnronous vs timing functions

You can use Asyncronous and event listeners to wait
